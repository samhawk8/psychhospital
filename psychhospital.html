  <p><span class="firstcharacter">J</span>ust three years ago, the words “oriental” and “negro” were removed from federal law, after a bill to ban the offensive words unanimously passed through congress.</p>

  <p>Another attempt to change the federal government’s vocabulary is underway, but unlike its predecessor in 2016, the bill seems far less likely to fly through congress.</p>

  <p>The term on the chopping block is “Illegal Alien.” </p>

  <p>It refers to noncitizens who are in a country without proper authorization, and fell mostly out of use with politicians until last year, when President Donald Trump amped up his use of the term to refer to all authorized immigrants.</p>

  <p>According to Factba.se, which tracks all of Trump’s public comments, Trump only used the term a handful of times on the campaign trail in 2015, though he was talking about illegal immigration almost every day. Even throughout the first year of his presidency, Trump only said “illegal alien” three times in public comments. </p>

  <p>But, last year, the president’s use of the term skyrocketed to a whopping 123 times in tweets, speeches and political rallies. He’s used it 45 times this year. </p>

  <p>Dr. Otto Santa Ana, professor of linguistics at UCLA says “illegal alien” is used intentionally by the President to strike fear into the hearts of Americans and push his immigration agenda. It demonizes immigrant communities, he says, and tries to make a powerful nation fear the powerless. </p>

    <p>“They are no longer people that need to be considered the way we would consider Tom and Mary Jones from Orange County California,” Santa Ana said. “It’s easy to conceptualize them as a horror, as dangerous, as inferior, as someone who will destroy the fabric of American society.” </p>

<p>It’s why Rep. Joaquin Castro, R-TX, introduced the legislation, which would change any reference to “illegal alien” or “alien” in any federal statue, rule, regulation, excutive order, publication or any other federal document to “foreign national” and “undocumented foreign national.” </p>

<p>“Words matter,” Castro said in a press release about the Correcting Hurtful and Alienating Names in Government Expression (CHANGE) Act. “The words ‘alien’ and ‘illegal alien’ work to demonize and dehumanize the migrant community. They should have no place in our government’s description of human beings.” </p>

<p>But, opponents of the change say using new “feel-good terms” push an open-borders agenda and create the false impression that the U.S. government isn’t documenting immigrants fast enough, or making minor administrative errors. </p>

<p>“The immigration process isn’t like applying for a municipal parking permit or a library card – it is much more complex,” Matt O’Brien of the The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) said to Capital News Service in an email. </p>

<p>“And it is a complicated process because it involves vetting people from all over the world in order to determine whether they present a threat to the economy, public safety and national security of the United States.”</p>

<p>FAIR said “alien” has been used for hundreds of years as a neutral term to describe someone who is a foreigner. </p>

<p>In April 2013, The Associated Press revised its guidelines to abandon “alien” and “illegal alien” and instead encouraged journalists to specify how someone entered the country and from where. </p>

<p>For example, an unauthorized immigrant may have been brought to the United States against their will, such as a victim of sex trafficking. Some might have come under “temporary protected status” because of turmoil in their home country, and the government later removed their protected status. And it’s estimated that about half of unauthorized immigrants in the US came here legally, but overstayed their VISA. </p>

<p>“The term is a problem because you would think if someone is an illegal alien, that means they are all in the same boat,” Haque said, who argues that “illegal alien” is overly simplistic and legally inaccurate. He also says it can do a lot of harm in the way immigrants are treated. </p>

<p>“It allows characterization of a large group of people to be less entitled to compassion or dignity,” Haque said. “It allows people to dehumanize the immigrants themselves and cast their entire existence as illegal.”</p>

<p>“The broader the term is used, the more it’s meant to demonize immigrants and portray them as criminals.”</p>

<p>Most immigrants aren’t criminals. Because crossing the border without authorization is a misdemeanor, but overstaying a VISA is not, someone’s presence in the United States is a civil infraction--not a criminal offense. </p>

<p>And the notion that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes has been dashed with several studies showing both legal and illegal immigration does not lead to rising crime. While 6% of US citizens are felons, only 2% of immigrants are felons. </p>

<p>But “criminal aliens” is an even more frequent phrase in Trump’s vocabulary than “illegal aliens.”</p>

<p>The president used the term 53 times in 2016, 26 times in 2017 and 112 times in 2018 in tweets, political rallies and speeches. He has used it 32 times this year.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the bill cannot correct the president’s vocabulary-- It would simply eliminate references to aliens from federal documents. </p>

  <p>“If certain members of our legislature dislike our immigration laws, they should propose meaningful changes,” O’Brian said. </p>

  <p>“But putting forward silly legislation that proscribes the use of standard legal terminology is pointless and shows a stunning lack of willingness to engage in serious debate aimed at formulating wise immigration policies.”</p>

  <p>Still, language matters to supporters of the bill. </p>

  <p>“What you see is what you get,” Dr. Santa Ana said. “We construct our world in terms of the way we label things.” </p>
